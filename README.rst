Requirements and Setup
----------------------

After repo has been pulled onto local machine, we recommend designating a new
virtualenv for the project.

Make sure to have postgresql installed **prior** to installing the
requirements, or it will fail!  If you don't have postgresql installed, we
recommend using homebrew: `brew install postgresql`

Once pulled, navigate to the root directory of the project. All requirements
can be installed through the use of pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Run
---

To run the program:

1. Start postgres server (user=postgres, db=openedxstats)

2. Start django server
